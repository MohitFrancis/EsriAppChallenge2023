The mean summer temperature is 12.5°C and the mean winter temperature ranges from -11°C in the north to -8.5°C in the south. The mean annual precipitation is approximately 450-600 mm. The region represents a transition between mid-boreal and mid-cordilleran vegetation, which occurs on the lower southeastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains and the western edge of the Alberta Plain. Its mixed forests of lodgepole pine, trembling aspen, and white spruce with balsam poplar, paper birch, and balsam fir, are characteristic of the region. Aspen and open stands of lodgepole pine occur on drier sites; black spruce and tamarack are associated with wet sites. Conifers are more prevalent on cooler, higher elevations in the foothills, whereas aspen is more dominant in its lower plains section. The foothills, composed of Cretaceous sediments, rise abruptly above the plains and are mainly linear ridges, rolling plateau remnants, and broad valleys. Their summits range 700-1500 m asl in elevation. These strongly dissected uplands with local relief of 100-200 m are covered with thin, discontinuous, loamy glacial till, some peat blankets, and clayey lacustrine and sandy fluvioglacial deposits. Well-developed Luvisolic soils with some bare rock ridges and Gleysolic and Organic soils are dominant in the region. The ecoregion generally slopes and drains northeastward via the Peace, Athabasca, and Saskatchewan river systems. Characteristic wildlife includes moose, black bear, beaver, muskrat, wolf, snowshoe hare, waterfowl, sandhill crane, ruffed grouse, and other birds. Land use activities include commercial pulpwood and sawlog forestry, water-oriented recreation, and wildlife trapping and hunting. The major communities include Hinton, Edson, Nordegg, and Swan Hills. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 55 100.",146
MID-BOREAL UPLANDS,"This mid-boreal ecoregion occurs as 10 separate, mostly upland areas, south of the Canadian Shield (147), stretching from north-central Alberta to southwestern Manitoba. It includes remnants of the Alberta Plateau (139, 140, 141, 144) in Alberta, several prominent uplands known locally as the Thickwood (150), Pasquia (151), and Porcupine (152) hills in Saskatchewan, and the Duck (153) and Riding (154) mountains in Manitoba. The climate has predominantly short, cool summers and cold winters. The mean annual temperature ranges from -1°C to 1°C. The mean summer temperature ranges from 13°C to 15.5°C and the mean winter temperature ranges from -13.5°C to -16°C. Some areas of the ecoregion can be very cold with winter mean temperatures exceeding -17°C in northern Alberta. The mean annual precipitation ranges 400-550 mm. The ecoregion is classified as having a predominantly subhumid mid-boreal ecoclimate. These uplands form part of the continuous mid-boreal mixed coniferous and deciduous forest extending from northwestern Ontario to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Medium to tall, closed stands of trembling aspen and balsam poplar with white and black spruce, and balsam fir occurring in late successional stages, are most abundant. Deciduous stands have a diverse understory of shrubs and herbs; coniferous stands tend to promote feathermoss. Cold and poorly drained fens and bogs are covered with tamarack and black spruce. Consisting for the most part of Cretaceous shales, these uplands are covered entirely by kettled to dissected, deep, loamy to clayey-textured glacial till, lacustrine deposits, and inclusions of coarse, fluvioglacial deposits. Elevations range from about 400 to over 800 m asl. Associated with rougher morainal deposits are a large number of small lakes, ponds, and sloughs occupying shallow depressions. Permafrost is very rare and found only in peatlands. Well-drained Gray Luvisolic soils are dominant in the region. Significant inclusions are peaty-phase Gleysols and Mesisols that occupy poorly drained depressions. Dystric Brunisols occur on droughty, sandy sites. In Alberta, the ecoregion slopes gently and drains northward via the Athabasca and Clearwater rivers and their tributaries, whereas in most of Saskatchewan and Manitoba the uplands slope gently and drain northeastward via the Churchill and North Saskatchewan river systems. Characteristic wildlife includes moose, white-tailed deer, elk, black bear, timber wolf, lynx, snowshoe hare, beaver, and muskrat. Bird species include common loon, red-tailed hawk and neotropical migrants. Pulpwood and local sawlog forestry, water-oriented recreation, hunting, and trapping are the main land use activities. Agricultural activities are significant in southern parts of the ecoregion, particularly in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Major communities include Fort Assiniboine, Trout Lake, Peerless Lake, La Loche, Buffalo Narrows, and Île-à-la Crosse. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 45 200.",147
MID-BOREAL LOWLAND,"This ecoregion occupies the northern section of the Manitoba Plain from the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg to the Cumberland Lowlands in Saskatchewan. The climate is marked by short, warm summers and cold winters. The mean annual temperature is approximately -1°C. The mean summer temperature is  13.5°C and the mean winter temperature is -17°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 375 mm in the northwest to 625 mm in the southeast. The ecoregion is classified as having a subhumid mid-boreal ecoclimate. It is part of the boreal mixed coniferous and deciduous forest, extending from Lac Seul in northwestern Ontario to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. It is a relatively flat, low-lying region with extensive wetlands covering approximately half the area. The cold and poorly drained fens and bogs are covered with tamarack and black spruce. The mixed deciduous and coniferous forest is characterized by medium to tall, closed stands of trembling aspen and balsam poplar with white and black spruce, and balsam fir occurring in late successional stages. Permafrost occurs in isolated patches in peatlands and is more prevalent in the region's northeastern section. Underlain by flat-lying, Palaeozoic limestone bedrock, the ecoregion is covered almost entirely by level to ridged glacial till, lacustrine silts and clays, and extensive peat deposits. Eutric Brunisols developed on extremely calcareous, loamy glacial till and Mesisols on forest peat are codominant, and are associated with local areas of limestone bedrock outcroppings and Gray Luvisols on loamy to clayey-textured lacustrine deposits. Wildlife includes moose, black bear, wolf, lynx, showshoe hare, waterfowl including duck, goose, pelican, sandhill crane, ruffed grouse, and other birds. Pulpwood and local sawlog forestry, water-oriented recreation, and wildlife trapping and hunting are the dominant uses of land in this region, although seed grains, oilseeds and forage crops are produced where soils and drainage are suitable. The major communities include The Pas and Grand Rapids. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 18 300.",148
BOREAL TRANSITION,"This ecoregion extends from southern Manitoba to central Alberta. The ecoregion is characterized by warm summers and cold winters. The mean annual temperature is approximately 1°C.

INTERLAKE PLAIN,"This ecoregion extends northwestward from the southeastern corner of Manitoba to the Saskatchewan boundary north of the Porcupine Hills (Mid-Boreal Uplands 152). The climate is marked by warm summers and cold winters. The mean annual temperature is approximately 1°C. The mean summer temperature is 15.5°C and the mean winter temperature is -14.5°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 425 mm in the northwest to 575 mm in the southeast. The ecoregion is classified as having a subhumid low boreal ecoclimate. It is part of the dominantly deciduous boreal forest that extends from southeastern Manitoba to the Peace River in north-central Alberta. It presents a mosaic of farmland and forest, marking the southern limit of closed boreal forest and northern extent of arable agriculture. Its native vegetative cover consists of a closed cover of tall to low trembling aspen with secondary quantities of balsam poplar, an understory of tall shrubs, and a ground cover of mixed herbs. White spruce and balsam fir are the climax species but are not well represented. Open stands of tall jack pine occur on dry, sandy sites. Depressions are water-filled or are covered with sedges, willow, some black spruce, and tamarack. Underlain by flat-lying Palaeozoic limestone, the region is covered by broadly ridged, extremely calcareous, glacial till and by shallow, level lacustrine sands, silts, and clays. Predominant soils are Dark Gray Chernozems. Peaty Gleysols and Mesisols are usually associated with poorly drained depressions. The ecoregion includes habitat for white-tailed deer, black bear, moose, beaver, coyote, snowshoe hare, and eastern cottontail, as well as for waterfowl and colonial water birds like cormorant, gull, tern, heron, American white pelican, and grebe. Approximately 40% of the ecoregion is in farmland. Growing season length, available heat, and precipitation permit production of spring wheat, other cereal grains, oilseeds, and hay on the more suitable lacustrine soils. Native hay used for pasture is more prevalent on the stony, glacial till soils. The major communities include Swan River, Gypsumville, Winnipegosis, Riverton, Steinbach, and Selkirk. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 84 600.",155
ASPEN PARKLAND,"This ecoregion extends in a broad arc from southwestern Manitoba, northwestward through Saskatchewan to its northern apex in central Alberta. The parkland is considered transitional between the boreal forest to the north and the grasslands to the south. The climate is marked by short, warm summers and long, cold winters with continuous snow cover. The mean annual temperature is approximately 1.5°C. The mean summer temperature is 15°C and the mean winter temperature is -12.5°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 400-500 mm. The ecoregion is classified as having a transitional grassland ecoclimate. Most of the ecoregion is now farmland but in its native state, the landscape was characterized by trembling aspen, oak groves, mixed tall shrubs, and intermittent fescue grasslands. Open stands of trembling aspen and shrubs occur on most sites, and bur oak and grassland communities occupy increasingly drier sites on loamy Black Chernozemic soils. Poorly drained, Gleysolic soils support willow and sedge species. This broad plains region, underlain by Cretaceous shale, is covered by undulating to kettled, calcareous, glacial till with significant areas of level lacustrine and hummocky to ridged fluvioglacial deposits. Associated with the rougher hummocky glacial till, landscapes are numerous tree-ringed, small lakes, ponds, and sloughs that provide a major habitat for waterfowl. The ecoregion also provides a major breeding habitat for waterfowl and includes habitat for white-tailed deer, coyote, snowshoe hare, cottontail, red fox, northern pocket gopher, Franklin's ground squirrel, and bird species like sharp-tailed grouse and black-billed magpie. Owing to its favourable climate and fertile, warm black soils, this ecoregion represents some of the most productive agricultural land in the Prairies. It produces a wide diversity of crops, including spring wheat and other cereals, oilseeds, as well as forages and several specialty crops. Dryland continuous cropping methods for spring wheat and other cereal grains are prevalent. Major communities include Red Deer, Edmonton, Lloydminster, North Battleford, Humboldt, Yorkton, and Brandon. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 1 689 000.",156
MOIST MIXED GRASSLAND,"This ecoregion comprises the northern extension of open grasslands in the Interior Plains of Canada and is closely correlated with semiarid moisture conditions and Dark Brown Chernozemic soils. The mean annual temperature is approximately 2.5°C. In some areas of southwestern Alberta the mean annual temperature can reach 5°C. The mean summer temperature is 15.5°C and the mean winter temperature is -11°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 350-400 mm. Native vegetation is relegated to nonarable pasturelands, dominated by spear grass and wheat grass, and a variety of deciduous shrubs including buckbrush, chokecherry, wolf willow, and saskatoon. Patches of scrubby aspen, willow, cottonwood, and box-elder occur to a limited extent on shaded slopes of valleys, on river terraces, and ringing nonsaline depressional sites covered with meadow grasses and sedges. Local saline soil areas support alkali grass, wild barley, red sampire, and sea blite. The region is composed of upper Cretaceous sediments and covered almost entirely by hummocky to kettled glacial till and level to very gently undulating, sandy to clayey lacustrine deposits. Although Dark Brown Chernozemic soils are dominant, significant areas of Solonetzic soils occur, particularly in eastern Alberta. Intermittent sloughs and ponds provide habitat for waterfowl. White-tailed deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, rabbit, and ground squirrel are common in the region. Spring wheat and other cereal grains are produced by employing a wheat or other grain-fallow rotation. Oilseed crops are also becoming increasingly important. Minor irrigation of these crops occurs near Lake Diefenbaker in Saskatchewan and in southern Alberta. Waterfowl hunting is common, and recreation is important around several large reservoirs. Major communities include Fort Macleod, Lethbridge, Drumheller, Rosetown, Unity, Biggar, Saskatoon, Moose Jaw, Regina, Estevan, and Weyburn. The total population of the ecoregion is approximately 656 000.",157
FESCUE GRASSLAND,"This region of fescue grassland lies in the chinook belt of southwestern Alberta along the face of the Rocky Mountain foothills. The climate is characterized by warm summers and winters that are mild, due to moderating chinook conditions. The mean annual temperature is approximately 3.5°C. The mean summer temperature is 14°C and the mean winter temperature is -8°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 400-450 mm. The thick grass sward and Black Chernozemic soils are similar to those of the Aspen Parkland ecoregion (156, 161), but trees are found only in very sheltered locations along some of the waterways. This grassland community is dominated by rough fescue with lesser quantities of Parry oat grass, June grass, and wheat grass. Forbs are abundant and often include yellow bean, sticky geranium, bedstraw, and chickweed. Drier sites have an increased amount of needle-and-thread grass. Moist sites along stream banks, north-facing slopes, and seepage sites support shrub communities dominated by snowberry, rose, saskatoon, and silverberry. Grazing and tillage have disturbed most of the native vegetation in the region. Underlain by sandstones and shale, the surface is covered by undulating to rolling, loamy glacial till and clayey lacustrine deposits. Chernozemic Black soils are dominant in the region. Intermittent sloughs and ponds on the plains provide habitat for waterfowl. White-tailed deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, rabbit, ground squirrel, sage grouse, and duck are common in the region. The northern section of the ecoregion is almost completely cultivated. Its southern section, along the United States border, has a mixture of cultivation on the flatter portions and ranching on the rougher, ridged components of the uplands and foothills. The major communities include Beiseker, High River, and Cardston. The total population is approximately 528 000.",158
MIXED GRASSLAND,"This semiarid grassland ecoregion in southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta forms part of the shortgrass prairie in the Great Plains of North America. The mean annual temperature is approximately 3.5°C. In southern Alberta, west of the Cypress Upland ecoregion mean annual temperatures can exceed 5°C. The mean summer temperature is 16°C and the mean winter temperature is -10°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 250-350 mm. Moisture deficits in late summer are caused by low precipitation and high evapotranspiration. The natural vegetative cover is dominated by spear grass, blue grama grass, and wheat grass. June grass and dryland sedge are significant associates. Blue grama and spear grass predominate on drier sites, along with dwarf sedges. A variety of shrubs and herbs also occurs, but sagebrush is most abundant, and on the driest sites yellow cactus and prickly pear can be found. Scrubby aspen, willow, cottonwood, and box-elder occur to a limited extent on shaded slopes of valleys and river terraces. Local saline areas support alkali grass, wild barley, greasewood, red sampire, and sea blite. The region is composed of upper Cretaceous sediments and is covered almost entirely by dissected to kettled, loamy glacial till, undulating to dissected, loamy lacustrine sediments, and hummocky sandy eolian deposits. The region skirts the Cypress Hills with the area to the south being drained by the Missouri River system, and the area to the north by the South Saskatchewan River. The soils are mainly Brown Chernozemic with significant areas of Solonetzic soils. Pronghorn antelope, deer, sage grouse, short-horned lizard, western rattlesnake, coyote, rabbit, and ground squirrel are common species in the region. The production of spring wheat and other cereal grains occurs by employing a grain-fallow rotation. Flaxseed and durum wheat are also grown. About half of the region is cultivated with the remainder being used for pasture or rangeland. As part of the North American waterfowl migratory flyway and with its diverse wildlife habitat, the region provides opportunities for hunting and recreation. The major communities include Medicine Hat, Leader, Swift Current, Assiniboia, Maple Creek, Shaunavon, and Kindersley. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 187 200.",159
CYPRESS UPLAND,"This rolling upland in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan is an outlier of the montane vegetative zone that occurs on the lower slopes of the Rocky Mountains. The climate is cooler and more moist than the surrounding Mixed Grassland ecoregion. The mean annual temperature is approximately 3°C. The mean summer temperature is 15°C and the mean winter temperature is -9°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 325-450 mm. The Cypress Hills, rising abruptly 400-500 m above the surrounding plains, are composed of a mix of dissected Tertiary and Cretaceous sediments covered with glacial till, or with loessial deposits on unglaciated upper plateau sections. The Cypress Hills slope eastwards from a maximum elevation of 1465 m asl at the west side. Natural vegetation ranges from fescue and wheatgrass grasslands below 1000 m to a mixed montane-type open forest of lodgepole pine, deciduous trees, and shrubs at upper elevations. Numerous species, including larkspur, death camas, and wild lupine, are not found elsewhere on the prairies. Chernozemic Black and Dark Brown soils are dominant. Luvisolic soils under pine forests and loamy Regosolic soils on eroded valley slopes are also present. The ecoregion slopes eastward and is drained by deeply incised Frenchman River, and Battle and Swift Current creeks. Mule and white-tailed deer, pronghorn antelope, sage grouse, short-horned lizard, western rattlesnake, coyote, rabbit, and ground squirrel are common in the region. Audubon's warbler is a unique bird, which is not found elsewhere on the prairies. Physical conditions allow free-range livestock grazing and limited production of cereals on smoother lower slopes. Wildlife hunting and recreation are also important uses on rougher upper slopes. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 3900.",160
ASPEN PARKLAND,"This ecoregion extends in a broad arc from southwestern Manitoba, northwestward through Saskatchewan to its northern apex in central Alberta. The parkland is considered transitional between the boreal forest to the north and the grasslands to the south. The climate is marked by short, warm summers and long, cold winters with continuous snow cover. The mean annual temperature is approximately 1.5°C. The mean summer temperature is 15°C and the mean winter temperature is -12.5°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 400-500 mm. The ecoregion is classified as having a transitional grassland ecoclimate. Most of the ecoregion is now farmland but in its native state, the landscape was characterized by trembling aspen, oak groves, mixed tall shrubs, and intermittent fescue grasslands. Open stands of trembling aspen and shrubs occur on most sites, and bur oak and grassland communities occupy increasingly drier sites on loamy Black Chernozemic soils. Poorly drained, Gleysolic soils support willow and sedge species. This broad plains region, underlain by Cretaceous shale, is covered by undulating to kettled, calcareous, glacial till with significant areas of level lacustrine and hummocky to ridged fluvioglacial deposits. Associated with the rougher hummocky glacial till, landscapes are numerous tree-ringed, small lakes, ponds, and sloughs that provide a major habitat for waterfowl. The ecoregion also provides a major breeding habitat for waterfowl and includes habitat for white-tailed deer, coyote, snowshoe hare, cottontail, red fox, northern pocket gopher, Franklin's ground squirrel, and bird species like sharp-tailed grouse and black-billed magpie. Owing to its favourable climate and fertile, warm black soils, this ecoregion represents some of the most productive agricultural land in the Prairies. It produces a wide diversity of crops, including spring wheat and other cereals, oilseeds, as well as forages and several specialty crops. Dryland continuous cropping methods for spring wheat and other cereal grains are prevalent. Major communities include Red Deer, Edmonton, Lloydminster, North Battleford, Humboldt, Yorkton, and Brandon. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 1 689 000.",161
LAKE MANITOBA PLAIN,"This ecoregion stretches northwestward from the International Boundary with the United States to Dauphin Lake. It is one of the warmest and most humid regions in the Canadian prairies. The mean annual temperature ranges from 2°C in the north to over 3°C along the Canada-United States border. The mean summer temperature is 16°C and the mean winter temperature is -12.5°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 450-700 mm. The ecoregion is transitional between areas of boreal forest to the north and the aspen parkland of the southwest. It is a mosaic of trembling aspen/oak groves and rough fescue grasslands. Trembling aspen and shrubs occur on moist sites, and bur oak and grass species occupy increasingly drier sites on loamy to clayey, Black Chernozemic soils. Poorly drained, Gleysolic soils support willow and sedge communities. Lower and smoother than the Saskatchewan Plain to the west (Aspen Parkland ecoregion), the surface of the plain has an elevation ranging from about 410 m asl near the Manitoba Escarpment to 218 m asl at Lake Winnipeg. This low-relief ecoregion, underlain by limestone bedrock, is covered by extremely calcareous, broadly ridged glacial till in its northern half and by smooth, level, lacustrine sands, silts, and clays in its southern half. Wildlife includes significant waterfowl, as well as white-tailed deer, coyote, rabbit, and ground squirrel. Its growing season length, available heat, and precipitation permit the production of corn, spring wheat, and other cereal grains by dryland continuous cropping methods. Oilseeds, hay, and livestock production are more prevalent in the northern section owing to topography and stoniness limitations. Hunting and water-oriented recreation are additional significant uses of land. The major communities include Winnipeg, Portage la Prairie, Emerson, and Dauphin. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 782 100.",162
SOUTHWEST MANITOBA UPLANDS,"In Manitoba, this ecoregion includes two elevated uplands, the Pembina Hills (163) and Turtle Mountain (164).

BRITISH-RICHARDSON MOUNTAINS,"This ecoregion includes the Richardson and British mountains, located in the northern Yukon. This ecoregion is marked by short, cool summers. Winters are generally extremely cold, although winters at higher elevations are more moderate during frequent periods of temperature inversion. Major mountain passes can be subject to strong outflow winds, causing severe wind chill conditions. The mean annual temperature for the area is approximately -10°C with a summer mean of 6.5°C and a winter mean of -25°C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm in the northwest to approximately 400 mm in the southeast. This ecoregion is characterized by alpine tundra at upper elevations and subalpine open woodland vegetation at lower elevations. Alpine vegetation consists of lichens, mountain avens, intermediate to dwarf ericaceous shrubs, sedge, and cottongrass in wetter sites. Barren talus slopes are common. Subalpine vegetation consists of discontinuous open stands of stunted white spruce in a matrix of willow, dwarf birch, and Labrador tea. Sedge, cottongrass, and mosses occur in wet sites. The highest latitudinal limit of tree growth (white spruce) in Canada is reached in this ecoregion. The northern unglaciated Richardson and British mountain ranges reach 1675 m asl in the region's northern core. The southern Richardson ranges exhibit smooth, rounded profiles composed almost entirely of folded, sedimentary strata of Cambrian- and Palaeozoic-age rocks. The ecoregion includes a small portion of unglaciated plateau physiography composed of Tertiary sediments. Turbic Cryosols with Static Cryosols developed on colluvial and alluvial deposits are dominant. Low ice content continuous permafrost predominates in the southern half of the region with the ice content increasing in the northern half and towards the Alaska border. Limestone rock outcrops are significant. Magnificent examples of periglacial landforms, particularly cryoplanation summits and terraces exist in sedimentary rocks of the Richardson Mountains. Characteristic wildlife includes caribou, grizzly bear, Dall's sheep, moose, snowshoe hare, fox, and arctic ground squirrel. The ecozone is within the annual migration range of the Porcupine caribou herd. There are no permanent settlements within the ecoregion, and land uses are restricted to subsistence wildlife trapping and hunting. Recreation and tourism activities are associated with Ivvavik National Park which covers most of the British Mountains.",165
OLD CROW BASIN,"This ecoregion occupies the hills and pediment slopes that surround the Old Crow Basin in northwestern Yukon. The landscape is characterized by generally flat to gently rolling terrain lying within the unglaciated Porcupine Plain and Old Crow Range.

KLONDIKE PLATEAU,"This ecoregion lies along the Yukon-Alaska border extending southeastward to include the Dawson Range. The ecoregion is dominated by low-elevation terrain and includes the Wellesley Basin and portions of the Kluane and Klondike plateaus. The mean annual temperature for the area is approximately -5.5°C with a summer mean of 10.5°C and a winter mean of -23°C. Mean annual precipitation ranges 300-450 mm. Mean monthly air temperature ranges are extreme under this continental climate. The short, warm summers are in sharp contrast to the long, very cold winters. The official lowest temperature recorded in North America was at Snag in the southern end of the ecoregion.  On February 3, 1947 a temperature of -63°C was observed. Open black and white spruce forests with aspen and occasionally lodgepole pine are most prevalent in the warmer boreal sections. Black spruce and paper birch prevail on slopes underlain by permafrost. Balsam poplar occurs along floodplains. Scrub birch and willow form extensive stands in subalpine sections from valley bottoms to well above the treeline. Characteristic terrain features include smooth, unglaciated, rolling plateau topography with moderate to deeply incised valleys and large structural basins composed of level to undulating glaciated terrain. Most of the terrain lies 1000-1500 m asl elevation, the highest peak being 2148 m asl. Major drainage channels extend below 1000 m asl. The unglaciated Klondike Plateau is dissected by deep, narrow, V-shaped valleys. Permafrost is extensive and discontinuous with medium ice content in fine-textured valley deposits. Turbic Cryosols associated with permafrost and Eutric Brunisols developed on irregular, steeply-sloping, loamy colluvial materials are dominant in the region. Regosols occur on sandy floodplains. Characteristic wildlife includes caribou, grizzly and black bear, Dall's sheep, moose, beaver, fox, wolf, hare, raven, rock and willow ptarmigan, and golden eagle.

ST. ELIAS MOUNTAINS,"This ecoregion includes most of the St. Elias Mountains and Kluane Ranges in the Yukon and includes vast regions of ice fields and high elevation mountain peaks. The mean annual temperature decreases with elevation, but for major valley bottoms it is approximately -1.5°C,  with a summer mean of 9.5°C and a winter mean of -14°C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm at low elevations increasing with elevation and moving west to very high levels of more than 1000 mm in the ice fields. This ecoregion is a combination of permanent ice and snowfields with minor areas of rock outcrop, rubbly colluvium, and alpine tundra vegetation composed of low-growing heather, dwarf birch, willow, grass, and lichen. Wet sites in the vegetated areas support cottongrass and sedge. The St. Elias Mountains, composed of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata, are among the highest mountains in Canada with their serrated pinnacles ranging upward to 6000 m asl. The main peaks stand as isolated blocks separated by broad ice fields. As the limit of permanent snow is 2150 m asl, the mountains present great masses of ice and snow and are the source of many great valley glaciers radiating out towards the Shakwak Trench. Permafrost is continuous at high elevation and sporadic discontinuous at low elevation along the east side of the ecoregion. The few valleys that are included in the eastern portion of this ecoregion are dominated by morainal and fluvioglacial materials, with Eutric Brunisols being the most common soil development. Characteristic wildlife includes caribou, grizzly bear, Dall's sheep, and mountain goat. Much of the ecoregion is composed of protected areas including Kluane National Park Reserve, Kluane Game Preserve and the Tatshenshini-Alsek Wilderness Park in British Columbia. Land uses are dominated by recreational activities, including hiking, mountain climbing, and river rafting and kayak trips. There are no permanent settlements in the ecoregion.",173
RUBY RANGES,"This ecoregion covers the Kluane, Ruby, and Nisling ranges, Shakwak Valley (Trench), and Kluane Plateau. The climate is characterized by short, cool summers and long, cold winters. Winter temperature inversions are common, giving milder temperatures at higher elevation. Maritime air from the Gulf of Alaska periodically invades the ecoregion during the winter to produce mild spells with near-thawing temperatures. The mean annual temperature for the area is approximately -3°C with a summer mean of 10°C and a winter mean of -17°C. Mean annual precipitation ranges 250-300 mm. Northern boreal forests occupy lower slopes and valley bottoms. Open white and black spruce in a matrix of dwarf willow, birch, ericaceous shrubs, and, occasionally, lodgepole pine form extensive forests. Black spruce, scrub willow, birch, and mosses are found on poorly drained sites. Alpine fir and lodgepole pine occur in higher subalpine sections, whereas at highest elevations sparsely vegetated alpine communities consist of mountain avens, dwarf willow, birch, ericaceous shrubs, graminoid species, and mosses. The terrain consists of rolling to undulating hills above 900 m asl, and the highest peak is 2304 m asl. The most common soils in this ecoregion are Eutric Brunisols on sandy loam morainal or colluvial materials. West of the Nisling Range, there is an area of Turbic Cryosols on sandy loam morainal material. Regosolic soils are associated with active deposition of gravelly fluvioglacial outwash materials on braided floodplains. Volcanic ash from the 1300 year old White River eruption is up to 100 cm thick on lower slopes. In these cases, the soils are classified as either Regosols or Regosolic Turbic Cryosols, depending on the presence or absence of permafrost. Permafrost is extensive and discontinuous over most of the ecoregion decreasing to sporadic along the western side of the ecoregion. Characteristic wildlife includes caribou, grizzly and black bear, Dall's sheep, moose, beaver, fox, wolf, hare, raven, rock and willow ptarmigan, and golden eagle. Land uses reflect high recreational, tourism, and hunting values in alpine and subalpine sections. Mining potential is locally high.

YUKON PLATEAU-CENTRAL,"This ecoregion extends northward from Lake Laberge to the lower Stewart River in the central Yukon. The Yukon Plateau-Central ecoregion is composed of several groups of rolling hills and plateaus separated by deeply cut, broad valleys. The climate is cold and semiarid. The mean annual temperature for the area is approximately -3.5°C with a summer mean of 12°C and a winter mean of -19°C. Mean annual precipitation varies from 250 mm in the southern areas near Carmacks to 400 mm at higher elevations in the north and east. White and black spruce form the most common forest types. Black spruce is usually dominant in wetter areas. Lodgepole pine frequently invades burnt-over areas and very dry sites. Alpine fir occasionally forms the treeline but is sparse and is usually associated with white spruce and occasionally with paper birch. Sedge tussocks and/or sphagnum are common in wetlands. Scrub birch and willow occur in subalpine sections that extend up to the treeline. A significant vegetative feature of this ecoregion is the presence of extensive grasslands on all low-elevation, south-facing slopes. The forests suffer frequently from recurring natural fires such that seral communities are most common. Elevations are above 1000 m asl, except for major river valleys, which lie below 600 m asl in the northwestern portion. Several mountains reach heights of 1500 m asl. Eutric Brunisols developed on steeply-sloping, ridged to hummocky, loamy morainal and sandy fluvioglacial material are dominant in the ecoregion. Much of the ecoregion is covered by a veneer of recent volcanic ash 10-30 cm thick. Permafrost is discontinuous to sporadic with high ice content associated with fine-textured valley deposits. Turbic Cryosols are confined to wet depressions and beneath mature forests on lower, north-facing slopes. Characteristic wildlife includes caribou, grizzly and black bear, moose, beaver, fox, wolf, hare, raven, rock and willow ptarmigan, and golden eagle. Land uses reflect recreational, tourism, hunting, and trapping values as well as some forestry activities and mining. Major communities in the region are Carmacks and Pelly Crossing.

The population of the ecoregion is approximately 23 000.",211
SELKIRK-BITTERROOT FOOTHILLS,"This foothills ecoregion covers a somewhat drier section of the ""Interior Wet Belt"" than the adjacent Columbia Mountains and Highlands (ecoregion 205). It extends from the south-central part of eastern British Columbia south to the international border. The ecoregion embraces the southwestern flank of the Columbia Mountains and the southeastern portion of the Columbia Highlands. It is a complex of subalpine and moist montane vegetation zones. The mean annual temperature for the area is approximately 5.5°C with a summer mean of 14.5°C and a winter mean of -3.5°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 mm in the cedar-hemlock forested valleys to greater than 800 mm in the upland areas. The subalpine is characterized by forests of Engelmann spruce and alpine fir which predominate at 1200-2150 m asl. Open stands of alpine fir, larch, or whitebark pine may be found at higher elevations. In lower valleys, mature forests consist of western hemlock and western red cedar, and seral stands consist of lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir with some western white pine and western larch. The ecoregion is underlain by folded sedimentary and volcanic strata and massive metamorphic rocks of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic age, all are intruded by small to large bodies of igneous and volcanic rocks. The mountains in this ecoregion are somewhat lower and less rugged than the series of ranges to the north. Humo-Ferric Podzols with Dystric Brunisolic soils developed on irregular, steeply-sloping colluvial and morainal deposits are dominant at the upper elevations, while Dystric Brunisols are most common at the lower elevations. Characteristic wildlife includes mule and white-tailed deer, woodland caribou, grizzly and black bear, and grouse. Forestry, mining, outdoor recreation, tourism-related activities, and a limited amount of agriculture and grazing are the main land uses. The main communities are Trail, Castlegar, and Rossland. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 33 700.",212
SOUTHERN ROCKY MOUNTAIN TRENCH,"This ecoregion is a long, narrow complex of ecosystems that occupy the valley of this major geological fault that runs between the Columbia Mountains and the Rocky Mountains. The Southern Rocky Mountain Trench is a linear, steep-walled, faulted valley about 480 km long. The valley floor is relatively level and can vary in width from less than 1 km to 20 km. The headwaters of a number of large rivers lie in the trench. The northern limit of the ecoregion is around 54° N latitude and runs south to the border with western Montana. Climate tends to become warmer and drier moving from north to south. The mean annual temperature for the ecoregion is approximately 4.5°C with a summer mean of 14°C and a winter mean of -5.5°C. The mean annual precipitation is less than 500 mm in the southern end of the ecoregion around Windermere and Cranbrook, and 800-1000 mm in the central portion in the vicinity of Kinbasket Lake. Valley bottom vegetation ranges from bunchgrass, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir in the south, to western red cedar and western hemlock in the central portion, and to white and black spruce and lodgepole pine in the northern portions of the ecoregion. Underlain by Palaeozoic and Proterozoic strata, the trench is covered with a variety of glacial deposits including ground moraine, outwash plains and terraces, drumlins, eskers, glacial lake terraces, and recent alluvium. Large floodplains and wetlands have been formed by several large rivers that drain into and meander along the valley floor of the trench. Dystric and Eutric Brunisolic soils developed on steeply-sloping colluvial and morainal deposits dominate upland sites and well-drained valley floors. Gleysolic and Mesisolic soils occupy areas of wetlands. Characteristic wildlife includes elk, moose, mule and white-tailed deer, bighorn sheep, grizzly and black bear, cougar, coyote, grouse, and waterfowl. Land uses include forestry, water impoundment, grazing, hunting, recreation, livestock, forage crop production, and tourism. Some main communities are Cranbrook, Kimberley, Invermere, and Golden. The population of this ecoregion is approximately 45 000.",213
NORTHERN CONTINENTAL DIVIDE,"This high elevation, mountainous ecoregion spans the Alberta-British Columbia boundary from Banff to the United States border. Much of the ecoregion lies 1200-2000 m asl. Winter temperatures are moderated by frequent Chinooks, especially on the eastern slopes.  The mean annual temperature for the major valleys is approximately 3.5°C with a summer mean of 12.5°C and a winter mean of -6.5°C. The mean precipitation ranges 600-700 mm annually. Vegetation cover is elevationally stratified. Engelmann spruce and alpine fir make up old growth forests at higher elevations. Some hybrid spruce, western hemlock, and western red cedar occur at middle and lower elevations. Locations that have suffered recent forest fires are often characterized by closed canopied forests of lodgepole pine. The Continental Ranges south of Crowsnest Pass are characterized by linear ranges of carbonate-rich Palaeozoic and Proterozoic sedimentary strata. Unvegetated rock outcrops are common along ridges and peaks. Humo-Ferric Podzols and Dystric Brunisols with some Gray Luvisolic soils developed on irregular, steeply-sloping colluvial, morainal, and fluvioglacial deposits are dominant in the region. Characteristic wildlife includes wapiti (elk), bighorn sheep, marten, lynx, bobcat, cougar, wolverine, grizzly and black bear, mountain goat, and mule and white-tailed deer. Forestry, coal mining at higher elevations, and limited agricultural activities at lower elevations are common uses of land. Hunting and recreation are extensive land uses throughout. Portions of Banff and Waterton Lakes national parks fall within the ecoregion. Grazing or forage production occurs in the Alberta portion of the ecoregion. The main communities are Fernie and Sparwood. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 35 200.",214
COASTAL HUDSON BAY LOWLAND,"This ecoregion occurs along the southern coast of Hudson Bay, from the Seal River in Manitoba east to James Bay in Ontario. The ecoregion is marked by short cool summers and very cold winters. The mean annual temperature is approximately -4°C. Temperatures can be colder in the Manitoba part of the ecoregion reaching a mean annual low of -7°C. The mean summer temperature is 10.5°C and the mean winter temperature is -19°C. The mean precipitation ranges from 400 mm in the northwest to 600 mm in the east. The ecoregion has a high subarctic ecoclimate and is part of the broad area of tundra and boreal forest transition where the latitudinal limit of tree growth is reached. The vegetation is characterized by very open stands of stunted black spruce and tamarack with secondary quantities of white spruce. A shrub layer of dwarf birch, willow or ericaceous shrubs, and a ground cover of cottongrass or lichen and moss is predominant. Poorly drained sites usually support tussock vegetation of sedge, cottongrass, and sphagnum moss. Low shrub tundra vegetation consisting of dwarf birch and willow is also common. The ecoregion is part of the Hudson Bay Lowland, a distinct physiographic unit within the Hudson geologic platform, which is a large flat geological structure of Palaeozoic limestone. After deglaciation the ecoregion was inundated by the Tyrrell Sea and covered by marine sediments. This was followed by a continued uplifting of the land surface due to isostatic rebound. Along the Hudson Bay coast east of the Nelson River numerous, parallel, well-drained raised beaches present a striking pattern of successive white spruce-covered ridges, alternating with fens, polygonal peat plateaus, and peat plateaus. North of the Nelson River beaches are more subdued and the terrain is dominated by fens, polygonal peat plateaus, and peat plateaus. Peat plateaus occur often in parallel rows marking the underlying beaches. In the fens, small incipient palsa bogs are common. The coastal areas are dominated by marshes and shallow waters and extensive tidal flats, especially north of the Nelson River. Extensive tidal flats and well developed beach ridges of limestone shingles are found at the junction of Hudson and James bays. Wetlands occupy up to 75% of the ecoregion. Organic Cryosols formed on sedge and fibrous sphagnum peat are dominant; Mesisols formed on moderately decomposed sedge and woody peat are significant; and saline Regosols and Gleysols occur on silty to clayey marine sediments along the coast of the bay. Permafrost with low to high ice content is widespread throughout the ecoregion. Characteristic wildlife includes barren-ground caribou, polar bear, arctic fox, brown lemming, snow and Canada goose, swan, sea ducks, and shorebirds. White whale and seal are found in coastal waters. Human activities are limited to trapping and hunting, marine mammal hunting, fishing, recreation, and tourism. The major communities include Peawanuck, Fort Severn, and Churchill. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 1600.",215
HUDSON BAY LOWLAND,"This ecoregion extends from Herchmer in northern Manitoba to James Bay, and includes Akimiski, North Twin and South Twin islands in northern Ontario. The ecoregion is marked by short cool summers and very cold winters. The mean annual temperature is approximately -3.5°C. In Manitoba the mean annual temperature can exceed -5°C. The mean summer temperature is 11°C and the mean winter temperature is -18.5°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from less than 500 mm in the west to less than 700 mm near James Bay. The ecoregion has a low subarctic ecoclimate. Stands are denser and trees are larger than in the coastal ecoregion to the north. The vegetation cover is dominated by open stands of stunted black spruce, tamarack and white spruce. The shrub layer consists of dwarf birch, willow and northern Labrador tea. The ground cover is dominated by cottongrass or by moss and lichen. Dry sites often support open stands of white spruce with an ericaceous shrub layer, and a ground cover of lichen. Poorly drained sites have vegetation characterized by sedge and cottongrass tussocks or sphagnum hummocks. Balsam poplar, white spruce and paper birch are common along rivers. The ecoregion is part of the Hudson Bay Lowland, and is controlled by flat-lying Palaeozoic limestone bedrock, that slopes gently northeastward and eastward to Hudson Bay. The maximum elevation is about 120 m asl in the south. This area was also inundated by the postglacial Tyrrell Sea and covered by marine sediments. Gradual uplifting continues in this region as well. The ecoregion is an extensive, wet, flat plain characterized by poorly drained peatlands and small lakes, ponds, and creeks. The wetlands cover up to 75% of the area and consist of peat plateau and palsa bogs, and horizontal fens. In the northern section and along upland areas belts of raised beaches, resulting of isostatic, postglacial rebound are prominent. To the southwest and south the region is bounded by Archean crystalline bedrock covered by calcareous loamy till and clayey lacustrine deposits. Moderate to high ice content permafrost is widespread, especially in organic deposits and along the northern boundary. Organic Cryosols and Mesisols are the dominant soils developed on organic materials, whereas Eutric Brunisols are associated with marine and till upland deposits. Wildlife characteristic of the region includes barren-ground caribou, snowshoe hare, willow ptarmigan, snow and Canada goose, and shorebirds. Human activities, while limited, include mining, hunting, trapping, sport fishing, and localized tourism. Shamattawa is the principal community and the population of the ecoregion is approximately 1200.",216
JAMES BAY LOWLAND,"This ecoregion extends west from James Bay in Quebec to Attawapiskat River in northern Ontario. It is marked by cool, short summers and cold winters. The mean annual temperature is approximately -2°C. The mean summer temperature is 11.5°C and the mean winter temperature is -16°C. The mean annual precipitation ranges 700-800 mm. The ecoregion has a perhumid high boreal ecoclimate. It is an area of transition, lying between the coniferous and mixed forests of the clay belt to the south, and the tundra to the north. In the southern section and along rivers, the forests are composed of balsam fir, white and black spruce, trembling aspen, and paper birch. Most of the ecoregion is poorly drained, and the dominant vegetation consists of sedge, mosses, and lichens with or without stunted black spruce and tamarack. The ecoregion is underlain by flat-lying, Palaeozoic limestone bedrock of the Hudson Bay Lowland. These lowlands slope gently towards James Bay. Most of the Quebec section of the ecoregion is part of the Eastmain Lowland. The ecoregion consists largely of flat, poorly drained plains with subdued fluvial and marine features. Throughout the area, there are gravelly, well-drained belts of raised beaches, resulting from postglacial, isostatic rebound. To the south, the region is dominated by fine-textured lacustrine and marine deposits. Wetlands cover between 50% of the area in the south to over 75% of the area in the north and around James Bay. They are composed largely of northern ribbed fens, northern plateau bogs, and palsa bogs. The soils are dominantly Organic Mesisols and Fibrisols with some Organic Cryosols. Limited areas of Dystric and Eutric Brunisolic soils occur on upland sands. Eutric Brunisols and Gleysols are associated with river levees, while clayey uplands may have Gray Luvisol soils. Sporadic, discontinuous  permafrost with medium to high ice content in the north decreases to isolated patches surrounding James Bay. Mineral soil profiles exhibit uneven and often discontinuous or distorted soil horizon development as a result of past and present permafrost action. Characteristic wildlife includes barren-ground caribou, black bear, wolf, moose, lynx, and snowshoe hare. Bird species include the Canada goose, ruffed grouse, and American black duck. Land use activities include tourism and recreation, hunting, trapping, and fishing. The major communities include Attawapiskat, Eastmain, Waskaganish, and Moosonee. The population of the ecoregion is approximately 7100.",217
