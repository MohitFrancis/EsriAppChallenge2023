## Mission Statement

In Canada, populations of species at risk have declined by an average of 59 percent since 1970. According to the Canadian Species Index, between 1970 and 2016, the population size of monitored mammal species decreased by 42 percent on average and fish species by 21 percent.

On 14 December 2022, at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, the Government of Canada set the goal of conserving 25 percent of Canada’s land and water by 2025, and 30 percent by 2030 (colloquially referred to as the 30 by 30 Project).

Our WebApp **REPLACE WITH NAME OF APP** integrates existing ecoregions and key biodiversity areas (KBAs) in Canada, identifies and plots candidate sites of KBAs,, and seeks to assess whether these areas become newly created conservation areas **Will fix wording**.

The aim of WebApp **REPLACE WITH NAME OF APP** is to measure how well the provincial, territorial, and federal governments are complying with the goals of the 30 by 30 Project. Anyone can use the App, with the aim of raising awareness and pressure on our elected leaders.

**Mohit Francis:** Hello! My interests in human health, culture, and impacts (especially on the environment) led me to complete a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology and Evolutionary Anthropology, and a Certificate in Bioarchaeology from the University of Toronto. During my undergraduate studies, I learned of spatial analysis and the many methods of applying geographic information systems (GIS) technology. As someone who has always enjoyed analysing and working with big data, I wanted to learn more in the hopes of eventually working in a sector aligned with my interests. This led me to the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), where I'm currently enrolled in the GIS graduate certificate program for the 2022-2023 academic year.

The themes of this year's ECCE App Challenge - Conservation and Protected Areas or Urban Ecology - dovetail perfectly with my interests. On the academic side, for my term-long project at COGS, I am researching coastal erosion on the North Shore of Nova Scotia caused by extreme weather events. On the personal side, one of my most memorable experiences was being part of the volunteer tree planting and stewardship program organised by the Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Department of the City of Toronto. Planting native tree species and removing invasive species is a common ecological management technique in urban areas, of course. Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy watching and playing football (*incorrectly* called 'soccer'), and I hope to see Arsenal lift the title (knock on wood!) this May!
