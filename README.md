## Introduction

In Canada, populations of species at risk have declined by an average of 59 percent since 1970<sup>[1]</sup>. According to the Canadian Species Index, between 1970 and 2016, the population size of monitored mammal species decreased by 42 percent on average and fish species by 21 percent<sup>[2]</sup>.

To arrest further decline in biodiversity and habitat areas, decisive action is required from all stakeholders, from all levels of government, researchers, private enterprises, and the public. On 09 December 2022, at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, the Government of Canada set the goal of conserving 25 percent of Canada’s land and water by 2025, and 30 percent by 2030 (colloquially referred to as the 30 by 30 Project)<sup>[3][4]</sup>.

To meet this ambitious target, novel approaches are required. But there is great debate on which approaches to take, and how to achieve the above goals <sup>[5][6][7]</sup>


## Mission Statement

Our **REPLACE WITH NAME OF APP** integrates existing ecoregions and key biodiversity areas (KBAs) in Canada, identifies and plots candidate protected areas or sites of KBAs, and seeks to assess whether these areas become newly created conservation areas **Will fix wording**.

This is tool is not for analysis. The goal of **REPLACE WITH NAME OF APP** is not to identify high-risk areas or candidate KBA sites. That is beyond the scope of this app, and there is a lot of time, money, and man-power poured into those efforts Not all of that data is publically accessible either.

Instead, this is a reporting, compliance, and awareness tool. This is a tool created for the sake of transparency, which can be used by anyone for everyone, whether they work for the government, perform research on the field, own businesses, or are members of the public. The following questions are some of the questions we sought to answer with **REPLACE WITH NAME OF APP**:

- How well are the provincial/territorial and federal governments complying with the goals of the 30 by 30 Project?
- Will they achieve these goals?
- Where are existing protected areas?
- Where are current candidate sites?
- Where can more candidate sites be placed?
- If a new candidate site or area were to be created, how big should its area be?
- To what extent will its creation help in the progress of the project?
- How can the public holds its officials to account?

**François D'Entremont:** Hi! I'm a geospatial data enthusiast, and my interests in math, programming, machine learning, spatial analysis, and chess led me to pursue a graduate certificate in Geospatial Data Analytics. One of the coolest projects I'm currently working on is classifying pottery shards from the Levant using machine learning models. It's a fascinating challenge that allows me to apply my spatial analysis and machine learning skills to real-world problems. As a curious and passionate learner, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and explore new opportunities in the exciting world of geospatial analysis. Whether it's using data to make informed decisions or developing innovative solutions to complex problems, I'm ready for whatever comes my way. 

When I'm not busy analyzing data, you'll likely find me watching hockey games, cheering for my favorite teams, and enjoying all the action on the ice!

**Mohit Francis:** Hello! My interests in human health, culture, and impacts (especially on the environment) led me to complete a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology and Evolutionary Anthropology, and a Certificate in Bioarchaeology from the University of Toronto. During my undergraduate studies, I learned of spatial analysis and the many methods of applying geographic information systems (GIS) technology. As someone who has always enjoyed analysing and working with big data, I wanted to learn more in the hopes of eventually working in a sector aligned with my interests. This led me to the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), where I'm currently enrolled in the GIS graduate certificate program for the 2022-2023 academic year.

The themes of this year's ECCE App Challenge - Conservation and Protected Areas or Urban Ecology - dovetail perfectly with my interests. On the academic side, for my term-long project at COGS, I am researching coastal erosion on the North Shore of Nova Scotia caused by extreme weather events. On the personal side, one of my most memorable experiences was being part of the volunteer tree planting and stewardship program organised by the Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Department of the City of Toronto. Planting native tree species and removing invasive species is a common ecological management technique in urban areas, of course. Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy watching and playing football (*incorrectly* called 'soccer'), and I hope to see Arsenal lift the title (knock on wood!) this May!
