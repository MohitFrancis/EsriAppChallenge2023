## Mission Statement

In Canada, populations of species at risk have declined by an average of 59 percent since 1970. According to the Canadian Species Index, between 1970 and 2016, the population size of monitored mammal species decreased by 42 percent on average and fish species by 21 percent.

On 14 December 2022, at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, the Government of Canada set the goal of conserving 25 percent of Canada’s land and water by 2025, and 30 percent by 2030 (hereby referred to as the 30 by 30 Project).

Our WebApp **REPLACE WITH NAME OF APP** integrates existing ecoregions and key biodiversity areas (KBAs), identifies and plots candidate sites of KBAs, and seeks to assess whether these areas become newly created conservation areas **Will fix wording**.

The aim of WebApp **REPLACE WITH NAME OF APP** is to measure how well the provincial, territorial, and federal governments are complying with the goals of the 30 by 30 Project. Anyone can use the App, with the aim of raising awareness and pressure on our elected leaders.
